Space apps 2019 entry: 

__Challenge:__
> Living in our World:
>  __From curious minds come helping hands__

## App name & Team Name:

__Team name:__ Space paps
__Project name:__ Project Libra

### Problem:

>   The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates approximately 25% of human death and disease globally is linked to environmental hazards and Natural disasters, which increases to 35% for countries with underprivileged communities living in areas with potential of environmental hazards.

> According to the World Atlas statistics __the Philippines__ ranked __No. 9__ of the countries most prone to natural disasters, with approximately: __`4,416,499`__ of the total population affected.  


### Solution:

 > Create a Web-based platform that allows users of any expertise, or background to easily understand, view and assess communities that are vulnerable to environmental hazards.  In addition, credible organizations can publish recorded and realtime data from their projects related to the acquisition of data for environmental hazards, which would help create a more accurate repository of information.
 
### Tech Stack

- Node JS
- Socket.io (for Websockets)
- LowDB (embedded DB)
- Vanilla & React JS
- Ruby on Rails (for the unified data gathering API)
 
### Technical Components 

- Google Maps (Visualize the actual area affected by longitude and latitude)

- Ruby on Rails - Implement a Web scrapping approach for collecting data, from different web sources, to keep the integrity of the data intact


 
### Features:

- Uses NASA landslide record API
- Uses PAGA-ASA Project NOAH (Landslide Maps) Data
- `Uses PAG-ASA Flood maps` 
- Displays data in an elegant manner, simple and easy to understand even for non-technical people
- Supports a way to publish __recorded__ and __realtime__ data from data acquisition projects related to the context of disaster monitoring and risk reduction, sources could be from universities, government agencies and such.
